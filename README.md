I am Ibrahim Sheku Sesay, I am from Sierra Leone. I am currently living in Germany as an Asylum seeker. I am enrolled in an integration course at ReDI in Munich learning Introduction to Computer Science. Information Technology is the pivotal force to modern world activities regerdless of other professions. I always have the urge to learn Computer Science, but the opportunities are quite limited in my home country. Thankfully to ReDI for providing this opportunity to everyone without restrictions. The course has been very helpful to me because it teaches me a lot on Information Technology and also create links with bigger companies in and out f Munich. It helps us to meet high profile dignitaries from different works of life, some provide mentorship to us which helps in our daily life activities especially in the Business and Technology world. So, my experience has been so far amazing and career developed. Thank you.
